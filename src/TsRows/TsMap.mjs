/**
 * THE TYPESCRIPT HALF OF THE DEEP MAP - the node end, which PARSES and never stores.
 *
 *   node TsMap.mjs --root <tree> --rows <payload.json> [--state <state.json>] [--node-modules <dir>]
 *                  [--config <structuregate.ts.json>]
 *
 * Why the half is split here: `better-sqlite3` is a native addon, so a node that could write the database
 * would end the property every consumer of this exe depends on - two files, one of them a single NativeAOT
 * binary. The rows therefore leave as a payload FILE (tens of megabytes on a real workspace, which is more
 * than a pipe or a command line carries) and the rust store writes them into the database.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS MEASURED BY: every row the predecessor map published has exactly one row here carrying
 * the same facts, and this map publishes no row that one did not. A table is not done because its rows
 * exist, it is done because a row-by-row comparison of the two finds no difference.
 *
 * Protocol out, one record per line, the same shape the other halves speak:
 *   MAP-TOOLCHAIN|typescript <v>|@angular/compiler <v>|<tier>
 *   MAP-NOTE|<text>            something worth knowing that is not a failure
 *   MAP-SKIP|<reason>          there is no Angular workspace here, so there is nothing to map
 *   MAP-ROWS|<table>|<n>       one per table put in the payload
 *   MAP-FATAL|<message>        this half cannot run at all
 *   MAP-DONE|<files>           LAST line; its absence means the half died half way
