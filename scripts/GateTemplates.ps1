    GateTemplates.ps1 - the files Connect-Gate.ps1 writes into a consumer, as text.

    WHY TEXT AND NOT FILES IN THIS REPO. A second copy on disk here would be a file the gate of THIS repo
    counts and the map lists as imported by nothing, and it would drift from the copies already deployed in
    the consumer trees. A template with one placeholder each cannot drift from itself.

    Both carry the same note to their reader: Connect-Gate.ps1 wrote this, editing it is fine, and a
    re-connect leaves an existing file alone.

    Stop hook: refuse to finish a turn that left a structure rule broken.

    EXIT 2 IS THE WHOLE POINT. Claude Code hands a Stop hook's output back as something to fix only on
    exit 2. The gate exits 1 on a violation, which is right for a build, so the translation happens here.
