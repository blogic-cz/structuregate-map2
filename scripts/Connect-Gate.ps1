    Connect-Gate.ps1 - wire a project into structuregate in one command, repeatably.

      powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\Connect-Gate.ps1 -Path C:\src\app
      powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\Connect-Gate.ps1 -Path C:\src\app -DryRun
      powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\Connect-Gate.ps1 -Path C:\src\app -Entry hook -GateArgs '--doc-scope context'

    WHAT IT DOES, in order, printing a verb per step:

      1  register the tree as a GateConsumer here, which is the only list the deploy reads
      2  hard-link the two files (structuregate.exe, StructureGate.targets) into <Path>\buildtools, to
         the ONE release in this repo's buildtools\ - never a copy, never in the consumer's git
      3  pick the entry point from what the tree holds, and write it
      4  probe the language hosts, and install `typescript` into the tree when the .ts/.js half needs it
      5  junction this repo's skills into <Path>\.claude\skills
      6  build the first map and FREEZE what it cannot resolve and every file already over a limit, so day
         one is green

    STEP 6 IS NOT DECORATION. A tree connected without it starts red on findings that were true before the
    gate arrived - entry points nothing imports, run-time imports, files already over a limit - and a gate
    that is red on arrival is a gate somebody switches off. `--update-map-baseline` and `--update-baseline`
    record those counts as the ratchet, so only NEW ones fail. In a git tree the gate measures what git
    sees (`--tracked --include-untracked`): a build output or a vendored copy .gitignore keeps out is not
    the tree's code. Measured on the trees connected without both: most were red on arrival.

    Everything is idempotent: run it again after every gate rebuild. -DryRun prints the plan and writes
    nothing.

    FROM A RELEASE, NO CLONE. The GitHub release ships this script and its helpers in `scripts\` of the
    unpacked release Update-Gate.ps1 keeps under local app data. Run from there it registers the tree in
    that folder's `consumers.txt` (the list Update-Gate.ps1 reads), links the gate folder to the release it
    sits in and junctions the release's skills; step 2 only links, since the release IS the payload.
