//! THE DEEP MAP (`--map-sqlite`), EVERY HALF OF IT, and the order they run in - all in this library except
//! the two halves only .NET can parse: C# (Roslyn) and T-SQL (ScriptDom), which are asked for through the
//! caller's callback and answer with what they added.
//!
//! ONE PASS OVER EVERY ROOT: this writes a DATABASE, rebuilt rather than appended to, so a half run per root
//! left only the last root's rows behind. The paths already carry their root prefix.
//!
//! THE ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. TypeScript first, because it replaces its own rows whole; then python and rust,
//! then C#, which asks the database what it holds before it parses and needs the answer to still be true when it
//! writes; then SQL, and the links after both, since a link is a fact about two halves' rows; then what is
//! derived from the finished database - the seeds, the search index, the atlas.
