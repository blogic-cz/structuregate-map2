//! WHERE EVERY TRANSLATION KEY CAN BE TRAVELLED TO FROM A ROUTED ROOT — the four derived
//! tables, written into the store that already holds the rows they come from.
//!
//! IT RUNS HERE AND NOT IN NODE, and that is the whole point of the move: it is derived
//! from EVERY other table, so it needs every row. Keeping the store alive in node is fine
//! on a full run and impossible on an incremental one — node cannot read this database, and
//! handing the rows back costs about as much JSON as a `JSON.parse` can hold at
//! all.
//!
//! A KEY IS REACHABLE MORE THAN ONE WAY HALF THE TIME, so there is no "the" gate set, and
//! three columns say different things about it. THE UNIT OF ENUMERATION IS (REF, PATH): one
//! ref's own in-template gates joined to the gates of THAT path, never to another site's.
//!   `always_gates`       intersection over every (ref, path) — the ONLY column a consumer
//!                        may read as NECESSARY
//!   `maybe_gates`        union over the same — holds on SOME way in, not a requirement
//!   `path_always_gates`  intersection over the PATHS alone, own gates excluded — what the
//!                        render tree demands of the component, independent of where in the
//!                        template the key sits
//!
//! The first version of the tool this comes from got it wrong in a way worth stating,
//! because the numbers it produced looked fine: every ref's own chain was collected into ONE
//! flat list and unioned into every path of every component, so the intersection inherited
//! gates from sites the path never passes through and `always_gates` claimed conditions that
//! do not always hold. Read one path, call the key "requires feature X", and you are wrong
//! for more than one key in four.
//!
//! Two more columns say the same thing about MEANING rather than row identity, because an
//! intersection over ids is blind to ONE CONDITION WRITTEN TWICE:
//! `always_features`/`maybe_features` fold `gate_features` over the SAME (ref, path) sets.
//!
//! A KEY ASSIGNED IN TYPESCRIPT CARRIES THE `if`/`else` AROUND ITS WRITE (`key_branches`).
//! Those branches ride in the same (ref, path) sets, so the value and feature folds read
//! them like any gate, but they are published apart — `always_branches`/`maybe_branches`,
//! holding `branches` and `switch_cases` ids — because a `gates` column names `gates` rows
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! THERE IS NO PATH CAP. A cap of a few thousand paths per component looks safe, but on a
//! large workspace a single component exceeds it, so the cap hid real paths and bought nothing;
//! on another Angular tree one component rendered from everywhere holds most of the table, and the
//! cap would hide most of its paths. TWO TREES, NOT ONE NUMBER. Dropping the cap is a deliberate divergence from the first version.
//! `truncated` stays a column because a consumer filters on it, and is now always 0.
