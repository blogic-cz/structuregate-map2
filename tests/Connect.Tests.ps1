    Connect-Gate.ps1 end to end: what lands in a consumer, and whether it actually RUNS.

    WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE WIRING, not the report line beside it. A connect that prints six green verbs over
    a tree where nothing runs the gate is the failure this script exists to prevent, so each case drives the
    entry point it wrote: the Stop hook wrapper is EXECUTED against a tree with a violation in it, and the
    .csproj import is asserted to name the tree rather than the project folder.

    A junction is created in one case, so these cases never point the script at this repo's own `skills\`: a
    throwaway origin under TEMP is used instead. Remove-Item -Recurse over a junction has deleted the
    TARGET's files on Windows PowerShell before now, and the target here would be the origin every consumer
    links to.

    A BASELINE OVER AN UNREADABLE MAP IS THE WORST OUTCOME OF THIS SCRIPT. With no `typescript` resolvable
    from the tree, every .ts file is reported UNMAPPED - and freezing that records "nothing imports this"
    for files nobody could read. Measured on a real tree before this warning existed: nearly every file
    UNMAPPED, under a confident 0-edge summary.

# both as keys - and ConvertFrom-Json (5.1, and 7 without -AsHashtable) refuses a document with such keys. The script
# died after the map step: no UNMAPPED check, and no structure-baseline.json. The unreadable .ts proves the findings
# were really read, since only they carry the UNMAPPED that the warning counts.
